# Angry Plants 🌱🔫

**Angry Plants** is a pixel art browser game prototype built with HTML Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS.  
The idea is playful: the flowers became angry because nobody watered them, and they started attacking humans. The player's mission is to use a water gun to calm them down and make them happy again.

## ✨ Features
- Custom pixel art characters and assets (drawn by me)  
- Player movement and shooting mechanics  
- Basic sound effects and visual effects implemented  
- HTML Canvas rendering with JavaScript game loop  
- Fun and lighthearted concept
